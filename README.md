Finds nearest trains on Toronto rail system:
- GO trains based on real-time positions from http://gotracker.ca/
- VIA trains based on real-time positions from https://tsimobile.viarail.ca/
  (thanks for the link on https://ruk.ca/content/rail-open-data)
- UP Express trains positions estimated from UP GTFS
  (real-time data not available as far as I can tell)

Why? Because I can see trains from my window and was wondering where they go.
